<h1>Release Notes</h1>

<p>This section details major changes to each release. For more detail see the <a href="https://github.com/jamietre/ImageMapster/commits/master">commit history</a> on github.</p>

<h2>Version 1.2.5</h2>

<h3>Features:</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Zepto compatible:</b> ImageMapster will work with Zepto instead of jQuery using a special build to patche Zepto with a couple jQuery features that are not implemented by Zepto. This build is 
included in the distribution. The Zepto build is completely compatible with jQuery as well and will detect when jQuery is being used. But because it adds a little bit to the size of the 
plugin I'm keeping it as a separate build.</li>
<li>Allow passing options to <code><a class="popup" href="docs.html#set">set</a></code> to control rendering options at run-time.</li>
<li><code><a class="popup" href="docs.html#keys">keys</a></code> option allows accessing keys for an area, area group or key group.</li>
<li><code><a class="popup" href="docs.html#mouseoutDelay">mouseoutDelay</a></code> option allows a time delay after the mouse exits a hotspot before the highlight is removed.</li>
<li><code><a class="popup" href="docs.html#highlight">highlight</a></code> method allows control of highlighted area from code. 
This is different from the existing <code><a class="popup" href="docs.html#set">set</a></code> method, which selects or deselect areas. The new feature
mimics the effect of a mouseover, versus a click</li>
<li>Returning <code>true</code> from an <code><a class="popup" href="docs.html#onClick">onClick</a></code> event handler will cause navigation to the area's <code>href</code> url</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug fixes and improvements:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Rendering options can be changed on the fly without affecting areas that have already been rendered. Previously, while you could use <code><a class="popup" href="docs.html#set_options">set_options</a></code> to 
change any rendering option to a map that had already been bound, deselecting areas would cause everything to be redrawn with the new options.</li>
<li>Enable fade effect for IE 8 (requires applying opacity to child elements, IE8 specific problem)</li>
<li>Improve rendering sharpness for 1 pixel strokes by adding 0.5 pixels to coordinates that fall on a pixel boundary</li>
<li>Block UI events while resizing, would cause unpredictable behavior</li>
<li>Detect touchscreen devices and ignore <code>mouseenter</code> events improves mobile device performance</li>
<li>Fix flickering tooltips and areas when moving between adjacent grouped areas</li>
<li>Substantial performance improvements with large image maps</li>
<li>(bug) Fix tooltip positioning for <code>circle</code> and <code>rect</code> area shapes</li>
<li>(bug) Trim results of string splits so spaces don't cause problems. Spaces between keys in a list would cause failure.</li>
<li>(bug) Couldn't disable fill effect when using <code><a class="popup" href="docs.html#altImage">altImage</a></code></li>
<li>(bug) Fix for mask handling in Firefox 6.0</li>
</ul>

<h3>General:</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Method queuing:</b> All method calls are queued, and will be executed only after any pending async operations are finished (initial binding or resizing). 
Because ImageMapster binds asynchronously (as it needs to wait for images to finish loading), and the resize method can be called with effects that take time,
this was not safe prior to 1.2.5.</li>
<li>Refactor code into a modular architecture</li>
<li>Split into two separate builds (one for jQuery only, one for jQuery or Zepto)</li>
<li>Works if Explorer Canvas (a library to make HTML5 code work with Internet Explorer) is loaded. Though Excanvas isn't needed for ImageMapster, if it was included on a page, 
ImageMapster would fail.</li>
</ul>
