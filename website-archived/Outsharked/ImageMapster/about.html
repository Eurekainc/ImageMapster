<h1>About ImageMapster</h1>

<p>ImageMapster started as a fork of David Lynch's <a href="https://github.com/kemayo/maphilight">MapHilight</a> in early 2011. I wanted to add the ability
to keep areas selected. I had a lot of ideas for interesting things that could be done with image maps, so ended up adding many more features. In the months since this began,
I pretty much rewrote it from the ground up, but a few parts of the code, most notably the core VML rendering code, still inherit directly from its MapHilight roots. </p>

<p>I have put a great deal of effort into ensuring that ImageMapster will work reliably in many environments. Often, images will not be 
finished loading when the rest of a page has finished being configured. Javascript code will usually begin running before some page images have finished loading. It is critical 
that images be completely loaded before ImageMapster can configure itself: it needs to know their native and display sizes, make copies, and do other work.
The software uses a number of different methods, depending on the browser, to ensure that everything is ready when it begins configuration.</p>
<p> Additonally, ImageMapster
will <i>queue commands</i> issued to it before configuration is complete. This means you can write post-configuration code that works against your image map without concern
for the timing of images being loaded. Any commands that ImageMapster receives before it's done configuring will be queued, and processed in order once configuration
is complete.
</p>

<p>ImageMapster uses HTML5 canvases to do its work in modern browsers. In older browsers (Internet Explorer &lt; 9) it uses VML to achieve similar effects.
</p>

<p>ImageMapster works in all major browsers (IE6+, Firefox 2+, Opera, Chrome, Safari) and on mobile devices.</p>

<h1>About This Site</h1>
<p>
This is a prototype for a simple ajax web framework that intends to create a highly responsive experience for
people using modern browsers, but still work fine without Javascript. This way spiders can index everything normally, and
if for some reason a client isn't Javascript-enabled, they should still be able to see all the content (if not use the actual functionality which the web site is about!). It uses HTML5
history to make browser navigation work. If you're using Chrome, Firefox of Opera, the "back" button in your web browser should do just what you expect.
</p>
<p>Content is loaded asynchronously from standard HTML pages (fragments). At the back end I'm using <a href="https://github.com/jamietre/CsQuery" target="blank">CsQuery</a>, 
my C# jQuery port, to manage and manipulate server-rendered HTML. 
</p>
<p>
The modal dialogs are created with <a href="https://github.com/jamietre/simplemodal">Simple<b>r</b>Modal</a>, my little fork
of the venerable SimpleModal jQuery plugin, to simplify getting content with ajax and a few other improvements.
</p>
<p>The accordion control on the Demos page is done with a variant of Jan Jarfalk's <a href="http://unwrongest.com/projects/accordion/">Accordion</a>. 
(Why was it so hard to find a dead-simple jQuery accordion plugin?) His original work probably does a lot more than
my fork does.
